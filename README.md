# DNA Steganography
There are two programs involved in this DNA staganography :
* Program for Encryption
* Program for Decryption

#### Program for Encryption.

This program takes your secert message as input and then encrypt this message into a randomly generated DNA sequence of appropriate length.

###### Note: Your secret message must be a string of alphabets [a-z, A-Z], without spaces or any special character.

The program then gives a DNA sequence as an output having the secret message encrypted in it.
The same DNA sequence is also saved in a text file named "Encoded_DNA.txt".

#### Program for Decryption.

This program takes the Encoded_DNA.txt file as input to read the Encrypted DNA sequence.
The program then decrypt the encrypted DNA sequence to get the secret message and gives the secret message as oputput

The secret message is also saved in a text file named "Message.txt".
